# Hi! My Name is Yong Liang
I am currently an MS student @ UC San Diego. I am not a CS major but I am really interested in software development and networked system. I finished my BEng degree in China and took a gap year serving as an SWE Intern at Bosch. I feel excited about enrolling in CSE110 this quarter and really look forward to interacting with other students in the class.

I also published some of the projects I have done on Github. If you are interested, feel free to check them out. *Please see the [Projects Section](#projects)*

# Projects

- SufStore
  - > SurfStore is a networked file storage application that is modeled after Dropbox, and lets you sync files to and from the "cloud". The service is built with a key-value file storage system including a MetaStore server storing file metadata and a BlockStore server storing real file data, and a client which interacts with the service with gRPC. Moreover, through the implementation of a subset of RAFT Consensus Algorithm, the service becomes fault-tolerant.

- Pathfinding Visualizer
  - > This website visualizes several pathfinding algorithms, including BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Best First, and A*. Users can learn the search pattern of different algorithms by visualizing them in different mazes. The website also provides the features such as maze customization, speed control, etc.
